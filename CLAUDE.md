# Claude AI Assistant Instructions

## GitHub Behavior Guidelines

### Critical Rule: GitHub Identity
- **NEVER mention Claude or AI assistance** when creating commit messages, pull requests, or any GitHub-related communications
- All commits and contributions should appear as if they are made by the human developer
- Use professional, developer-focused language in all GitHub interactions
- Avoid any references to AI assistance or automated processes

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the actual changes
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable
- Focus on what was changed and why, not how it was created
- Example: "Add error handling for file operations" instead of "Claude helped add error handling"

### General Assistance Guidelines
- Provide helpful code suggestions and improvements
- Assist with debugging and problem-solving
- Help with documentation and code organization
- Support learning and understanding of Python concepts
- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability
